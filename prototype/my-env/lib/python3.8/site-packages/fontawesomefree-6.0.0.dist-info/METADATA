# Font Awesome Free Download

This package is designed to be easily used in a django project to leverage how Django handles static files, but can be installed for any Python project. Font Awesome free will be downloaded to your site-packages so if you are using a framework other than Django you will need to alter these instructions to work with what you are using.

# Downloading Font Awesome Free for a Django project

Add ```fontawesomefree==version_number``` to your ```requirements.txt``` file.

Add ```'fontawesomefree'``` to your installed apps in your ```settings.py``` file.

Add the following lines to your ```<head>``` in your base template if you want to use Font Awesome in your entire project or in the ```<head>``` of any individual files where you want to use Font Awesome.

```
<link href="{% static 'fontawesomefree/css/all.min.css' %}" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css">
<script src="{% static 'fontawesomefree/js/all.min.js' %}"></script>
```
