            <center><h3>About AIC-IIITKottayam Incubation Centre</h3></center>
            
            <p>The incubation centre, AIC IIITKottayam Foundation, is a non-profit Sec.8 company. It is sanctioned under
              the
              Atal Innovation Mission scheme of Govt. of India.
              The centre
              will address the existing problems of entrepreneurs by providing them
              sufficient input in terms of knowledge, guidance, mentoring, training, and demonstrations.
              In addition, the space and facility will be provided to them.
              The centre will incubate customers to increase the utility of technology relating to IoT and Cloud
              solutions for societal benefits.</p>

            <p> Incubates at AIC-IIITKottayam will get opportunities to create their prototype and implement them after
              a thorough market analysis is achieved from their end.
              The product prototype could be initially designed with a 3D printer (if required); the software prototype
              could be designed
              at the computing space available at AIC-IIITKottayam; and, the real implementation could be carried out at
              the hardware level. </p>

            <p> In addition, the software services, including platform services, will be designed considering the
              end-to-end holistic picture
              of the product in the mind. Later, the models will be exhibited jointly with the sales department of
              AIC-IIITKottayam. </p> <br><br>
